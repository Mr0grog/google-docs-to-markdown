This is a test of block-level code formatting.

```
Consecutive lines
That are monospaced,
Whether multi-paragraph or not,
Are turned into code blocks.
```

Also, actual “code blocks” become Markdown code blocks:

```javascript
for (const i = 0; i < someList.length; i++) {
  doSomething(someList[i]);
}

// ^^ Blank lines in the block should be ok ^^
```

And a block with no language:

```
let whatever = "hello"
```

OK?
