This is a test of code formatting.

Text that is `monospaced` should be interpreted as code.

    Consecutive lines
    That are monospaced,
    Whether multi-paragraph or not,
    Are turned into code blocks.

Also, actual “code blocks” become Markdown code blocks:

    for (const i = 0; i < someList.length; i++) {
      doSomething(someList[i]);
    }

    // ^^ Blank lines in the block should be ok ^^

OK?
