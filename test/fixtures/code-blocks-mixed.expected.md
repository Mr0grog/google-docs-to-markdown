This is a test of block-level code formatting where block level elements have mixed code and non-code lines.

This is plain text in a paragraphâ€¦

    // With some lines
    // That are code

And how about code in a list?

- Normal text
- `// An item that is one line of code`
-     // An item with multiple lines
      // That are all code
- Some non-code description and:

        // Some lines of code
        // in the list item

OK?
